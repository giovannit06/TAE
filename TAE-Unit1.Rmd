## Unit 1

### Getting started with R

```{r}
# R can be used as a basic calculator
8*6
2^16
# R works in terms of functions and variables
# A function can take in several arguments, or input and returns
# an output value
sqrt(2)
abs(-65)
# To save the output of a function, it's possible to saving it to a variable
SquareRoot2 = sqrt(2)
SquareRoot2
# Don't use spaces in variable names, don't start variable names with a number
# It's possible to do assignement with '=' or '<-'
HoursYear <- 365*24
HoursYear

# List all variable created in the session
ls()
```

### Vectors and Data Frames

```{r}
# A vector is a series of numbers or characters stored as the same object
# You can creat a vector in R using the 'c' function (combine)
c(2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
# Create a vector of country names
Country = c("Brazil", "China", "India", "Switzerland", "USA")
# Then enter the life expectancies in the same order
LifeExpectancy = c(74, 76, 65, 83, 79)
Country
LifeExpectancy
# If you want to display an element of a vector, use square brackets
Country[1] # To get the first
LifeExpectancy[3] # To get the third
# Another nice function to create vectors is the 'seq' function
seq(0, 100, 2) # This give a sequence of numbers from 0 to 100 and the numbers increment of two
# Some algorithms require all of the data to be in a sigle object like a data frame
CountryData = data.frame(Country, LifeExpectancy)
CountryData
# To add another variable to the data
CountryData$Population=c(199000, 1390000, 1240000, 7997, 318000)
CountryData
# To add two new observations
Country = c("Australia", "Greece")
LifeExpectancy = c(82, 81)
Population = c(23050, 11125)
# Then we create a new data frame
NewCountryData = data.frame(Country, LifeExpectancy, Population)
NewCountryData
# The 'rbind' function combines both data frames by stacking the rows
AllCountryData = rbind(CountryData, NewCountryData)
AllCountryData
```
